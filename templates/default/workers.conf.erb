# This example config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage multiple Sidekiq instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# NOTE: This is heavily inspired by Sidekiq's example sidekiq.conf
#
# See sidekiq.conf for how to manage a single Sidekiq instance.
#
# Use "stop workers-<%= @app_name %>" to stop all Sidekiq instances.
# Use "start workers-<%= @app_name %>" to start all instances.
# Use "restart workers-<%= @app_name %>" to restart all instances.
# Crazy, right?
